# Python-Console-app

This application is developed in Python using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach and runs in the console, providing functionality for managing students and their grades across different subjects. Users can add, update, delete, find, sort, filter and view student information, as well as assign grades for various courses. The app includes basic commands for easy data management and is built around CRUD principles (Create, Read, Update, Delete), enabling efficient administration of students and their academic performance. The TDD approach ensures the application is thoroughly tested, resulting in reliable and maintainable code.
